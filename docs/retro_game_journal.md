# Retro game journal ðŸ“”

<img src="/img/retro_game_journal.png" style={{width: 600, paddingRight: 8}} />

As a game developer, playing games is not only a passion by a school, by playing retro games
I can get inspiration, learn new game design and on top of all, have fun.

Retro game journal is about recording games that I beat, found interesting and worth registering
their highlights, so it will server as both as a journal from the games that I enjoyed and learned
from, but also, hopefully, the information in them will help fellow gamers/game developers.

All issues will follow the same format, where in a single page, a brief summary and the highlights
of the game will be found, the idea is for the content to be short and to the point and just live
as a reminder and a call up to a fun, interesting game.
